# Deno CloudSpec AWS CDK

This is a proof of concept for a [Deno](https://deno.land/) based cloudspec project.

Run the [test](./awscdk.test.ts) (expects a valid AWS session either in env or via AWS SSO profile)

You'll need to have Deno [installed](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.2/getting_started/installation)

```
deno test --no-check --allow-all
```

This will deploy an AWS CDK stack as part of the test and make expectations on the stack outputs.
